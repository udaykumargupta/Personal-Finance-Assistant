## üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture

This project follows a professional, multi-layered architecture to ensure separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability.

**Backend: MVC + Service + Repository Pattern**

-   **Controller Layer:** Handles all incoming HTTP requests, performs validation, and delegates business logic to the service layer.
-   **Service Layer:** Contains the core business logic of the application. It acts as an intermediary between the controllers and repositories.
-   **Repository Layer:** Manages all data access and persistence using Spring Data JPA, abstracting away the database interactions.

This clean architecture makes the application robust, easy to test, and simple to extend with new features.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
- JDK 17 or later
- Maven
- Node.js and npm
- PostgreSQL (or another configured database)

### Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/personal-finance-assistant.git](https://github.com/your-username/personal-finance-assistant.git)
    cd personal-finance-assistant/backend
    ```

2.  **Configure Database:**
    - Open `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
    - Update the `spring.datasource.url`, `spring.datasource.username`, and `spring.datasource.password` properties to match your local database configuration.

3.  **Set Up Google Cloud Vision API:**
    - Create a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    - Enable the **Cloud Vision API**.
    - Create a **Service Account**, grant it the `Cloud Vision AI User` role, and download the JSON key file.
    - Create a `.env` file in the root of the backend project (`/backend/.env`).
    - Add the following line to your `.env` file, pointing to your downloaded key:
      ```dotenv
      GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/gcp-keyfile.json
      ```

4.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    ```sh
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    The backend will be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```sh
    cd ../frontend
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Frontend Development Server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port specified by Vite).
